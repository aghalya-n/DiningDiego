course-project-group-12 created by GitHub Classroom

This is a full stack interactive web application that was created primarily using React and Java. It displays crowd levels at different times at the dining halls of the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. It was created with making receiving meals convenient for busy students in mind. On the page, it displays each of the dining halls at UIUC, and the user can select and interact with the dining hall of their choice in order to visualize the crowd at a specific time.

The front end of this project was built mainly using Javascript's React library in addition to CSS for formatting, fonts, and coloring. The backend was built using Java and Python (specifically the pandas library) to coordinate, organize, and analyze the student crowd data at various times that we received through contacting UIUC housing.

If you potentially want to interact with our code, ensure you have cloned the repository first. You should have an editor that can work with Java, CSS, Python, and React. You will need to download React and all of its associating frameworks (i.e. bootstrap). In addition, you should import pandas as well as all javax.persistence API members.

Roles of project members:

Nathan Joseph gathered and organized all of the university dining hall data, as well as completed the information analysis by working with Python.

Sreyansh Mamidi worked on the front end of the web application using React and CSS, in addition to integrating the front end with the back end.

Siddarth Tangri integrated the Python data with Java and furnished the back end using Java to parse the data and output the right values of the crowd levels corresponding to certain times on each day of the week.

Aghalya Narayanan worked on the front end of the web application using React, in addition to completing the Readme file to explain the project to viewers.
